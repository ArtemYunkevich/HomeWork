<p><i>Verse 1</i>
<br>Target on my back
<br>Lone survivor lasts
<br>They got me in their sights
<br>No surrender no
<br>Trigger fingers go
<br>Living the dangerous life
<br>Hey, hey, hey
<br>Everyday when I wake
<br>I'm trying to get up; they're knocking me down
<br>(Chewing me up, spitting me out)
<br>Hey, hey, hey
<br>When I need to be saved
<br>You're making me strong; You're making me stand
<br>(Never will fall, never will end)
<br>Shot like a rocket up into the sky
<br>Nothing could stop me tonight

</p>

<p>
<i>Chorus</i>
<br>You make me feel invincible
<br>Earthquake, powerful
<br>Just like a tidal wave
<br>You make me brave
<br>You're my titanium
<br>Fight song, raising up
<br>Like a roar of victory in a stadium
<br>Who can touch me cause I'm
<br>(I'm made of fire)
<br>Who can stop me tonight
<br>(I'm hard wired)
<br>You make me feel invincible
<br>I feel, I feel it
<br>Invincible (x2)
</p>

<p><i>Verse 2</i>
<br>Here we go again
<br>I will not give in
<br>I've got a reason to fight
<br>Every day we choose
<br>We might win or lose
<br>This is the dangerous life
<br>Hey, hey, hey
<br>Everyday when I wake
<br>They say that I'm gone; they say that they've won
<br>(The bell has been rung; it's over and done)
<br>Hey, hey, hey
<br>When I need to be saved
<br>They counting me out, but this is my round
<br>(You in my corner; look at me now)
<br>Shot like a rocket up into the sky
<br>Nothing could stop me tonight
</p>
