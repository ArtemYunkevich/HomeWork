<p><i>Verse 1</i>
<br>I'm just a step away
<br>I'm a just a breath away
<br>Losin my faith today
<br>(JEN: Fallin off the edge today)
<br>I am just a man
<br>Not superhuman
<br>(JEN: I'm not superhuman)
<br>Someone save me from the hate
<br>It's just another war
<br>Just another family torn
<br>(JEN: Falling from my faith today)
<br>Just a step from the edge
<br>Just another day in the world we live
</p>

<p>
<i>Chorus</i>
<br>I need a Hero to save me now

<br>A Hero'll save me
<br>(JEN: Just in time)
</p>

<p><i>Verse 2</i>
<br>I gotta fight today
<br>To live another day
<br>Speakin my mind today
<br>(JEN: My voice will be heard today)
<br>I've gotta make a stand
<br>But I am just a man
<br>(JEN: I'm not superhuman)
<br>It's just another war
<br>Just another family torn
<br>(JEN: My voice will be heard today)
<br>It's just another kill
<br>The countdown begins to destroy ourselves
</p>

<p><i>Bridge</i>
<br>Who's gonna fight for what's right
<br>Who's gonna help us survive
<br>We're in the fight of our lives
<br>(JEN: And we're not ready to die)
<br>Who's gonna fight for the weak
<br>Who's gonna make 'em believe
<br>I've got a Hero
<br>(JEN: I've got a Hero)
<br>Livin in me
<br>I'm gonna fight for what's right
<br>Today I'm speaking my mind
<br>And if it kills me tonight
<br>(JEN: I will be ready to die)
<br>A Hero's not afraid to give his life
<br>A Hero's gonna save me just in time
</p>
