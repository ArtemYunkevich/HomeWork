<p><i>Verse 1</i>
<br>I hear them talk to me
<br>But they're not listening
<br>Their words are kerosene
<br>They don't know who I am
<br>They'd never understand
<br>What it's like to be me
<br>I don't wanna be here
<br>So stuck inside
<br>Tell me how long have I been here
<br>I'm losing track of time
<br>In all this loneliness
<br>In all this emptiness
<br>Been stuck inside this room like a prison sentence
<br>I'm not gonna stay
<br>Tell me there's a way
</p>

<p>
<i>Chorus</i>
<br>High above it all (High above)
<br>Victorious victorious
<br>Far too long I've crawled (Far too long)
<br>In hopelessness I'm over this
<br>Don't give up on me (Don't give up on me)
<br>Tell me you believe (Tell me you believe)
<br>I can face it all (Face it all)
<br>Victorious victorious
</p>

<p><i>Verse 2</i>
<br>Can't change this overnight
<br>Though heaven knows I've tried
<br>Here I go again
<br>I need a savior now
<br>Someone to break me out
<br>Who's been the place I've been
<br>Don't wanna be forgotten
<br>When I'm dead and gone
<br>I just want to be the one who
<br>Got up and came back strong
</p>

<p>
<i>Chorus</i>
<br>High above it all (High above)
<br>Victorious victorious
<br>Far too long I've crawled (Far too long)
<br>In hopelessness I'm over this
<br>Don't give up on me (Don't give up on me)
<br>Tell me you believe (Tell me you believe)
<br>I can face it all (Face it all)
<br>Victorious victorious
</p>

<p><i>Bridge</i>
<br>Help me
<br>Cause I'm falling
<br>When I can't sleep, but I'm holding on
<br>Can't face this night alone
<br>In all this loneliness
<br>In all this emptiness
<br>Been stuck inside this room like a prison sentence
<br>I'm not gonna stay
<br>Tell me there's a way
</p>

<p>
<i>Final chorus</i>
<br>High above it all (High above)
<br>Victorious victorious
<br>Far too long I've crawled (Far too long)
<br>In hopelessness I'm over this
<br>Don't give up on me (Don't give up on me)
<br>Tell me you believe (Tell me you believe)
<br>I can face it all (Face it all)
<br>Victorious victorious
