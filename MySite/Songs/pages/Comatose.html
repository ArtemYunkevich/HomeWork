<p><i>Verse 1</i>
<br>I hate feeling like this
<br>I'm so tired of trying to fight this
<br>I'm asleep and all I dream of
<br>Is waking to you
<br>Tell me what you will listen
<br>Your touch is what I'm missing
<br>And the more I hide I realize
<br>I'm slowly losing you
<br>Comatose...
<br>I'll never wake up without an overdose
<br>Of you!
</p>

<p>
<i>Chorus</i>
<br>I don't wanna live
<br>I don't wanna breathe
<br>'Less I feel you next to me
<br>You take the pain I feel
<br>Waking up to you never felt so real
<br>I don't wanna sleep
<br>I don't wanna dream
<br>'Cause my dreams don't comfort me
<br>The way you make me feel
<br>Waking up to you never felt so real
</p>

<p><i>Verse 2</i>
<br>I hate living without you
<br>Dead wrong to ever doubt you
<br>But my demons lay in waiting
<br>Tempting me away
<br>Oh, how I adore you
<br>Oh, how I thirst for you
<br>Oh, how I need you
<br>Comatose...
<br>I'll never wake up without an overdose
<br>Of you!
</p>

<p>
<i>Chorus</i>
<br>I don't wanna live
<br>I don't wanna breathe
<br>'Less I feel you next to me
<br>You take the pain I feel
<br>Waking up to you never felt so real
<br>I don't wanna sleep
<br>I don't wanna dream
<br>'Cause my dreams don't comfort me
<br>The way you make me feel
<br>Waking up to you never felt so real
</p>

<p><i>Bridge</i>
<br>Breathing life
<br>Waking up
<br>My eyes open up
<br>Comatose...
<br>I'll never wake up without an overdose
<br>Of you!
</p>

<p>
<i>Final chorus</i>
<br>I don't wanna live
<br>I don't wanna breathe
<br>'Less I feel you next to me
<br>You take the pain I feel
<br>Waking up to you never felt so real
<br>I don't wanna sleep
<br>I don't wanna dream
<br>'Cause my dreams don't comfort me
<br>The way you make me feel
<br>Waking up to you never felt so real
</p>

<p><i>Ending</i>
<br>Oh, how I adore you
<br>Waking up to you never felt so real
<br>Oh, how I thirst for you
<br>Waking up to you never felt so real
<br>Oh, how I adore you
<br>Oh... The way you make me feel
<br>Waking up to you never felt so real
