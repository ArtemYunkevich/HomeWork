<p><i>Verse 1</i>
<br>All I see is shattered pieces,
<br>I can't keep it hidden like a secret,
<br>I can't look away
<br>From all this pain in the world we've made.
<br>Every day you need a bulletproof vest
<br>To save yourself from what you could never guess
<br>Am I safe today,
<br>When I step outside in the wars we wage?
<br>Our future's here and now,
<br>Here comes the countdown...
</p>

<p>
<i>Chorus</i>
<br>Sound it off, this is our call:
<br>Rise in revolution!
<br>It's our time to change it all:
<br>Rise in revolution!
<br>Unite and fight
<br>To make a better life!
<br>Everybody, one for all!
<br>Sound off, this is the call:
<br>Tonight we rise!
<br>Rise! (x2)
<br>Tonight we rise!
</p>

<p><i>Verse 2</i>
<br>Like a hand grenade thrown in a hurricane,
<br>Spinning in chaos, trying to escape the flame.
<br>Yesterday is gone
<br>Faster than the blast of a car bomb.
<br>And when the scars heal, the pain passes
<br>As hope burns, we rise from the ashes.
<br>Darkness fades away,
<br>And the light shines on a brave new day.
<br>Our future's here and now,
<br>Here comes the countdown...
</p>

<p>
<i>Chorus</i>
<br>Sound it off, this is our call:
<br>Rise in revolution!
<br>It's our time to change it all:
<br>Rise in revolution!
<br>Unite and fight
<br>To make a better life!
<br>Everybody, one for all!
<br>Sound off, this is the call:
<br>Tonight we rise!
<br>Rise! (x2)
<br>Tonight we rise!
</p>

<p><i>Bridge</i>
<br>In a world gone mad (in a voice so sad)
<br>Sometimes it's crazy (crazy)
<br>To fight for what you believe
<br>But you can't give up (No)
<br>If you want to keep what you love... (Keep what you love)
<br>Keep what you love... (Keep what you love)
<br>Keep what you love...
<br>Never give up! No!
</p>


<p>
<i>Final chorus</i>
<br>Rise! Rise in revolution! (x2)
<br>Everybody one for all,
<br>Sound off, this is the call:
<br>Rise! Like we're alive!
<br>Tonight we rise!
<br>Rise! Make a better life!
<br>Tonight we rise!
<br>Rise!
</p>

<p><i>Ending</i>
<br>Rise! Rise!
<br>Rise in revolution!(x2)
<br>Rise!
