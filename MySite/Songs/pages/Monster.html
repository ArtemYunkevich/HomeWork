<p><i>Verse 1</i>
<br>The secret side of me
<br>I never let you see.
<br>I keep it caged but I can’t control it.
<br>So stay away from me: the beast is ugly.
<br>I feel the rage and I just can’t hold it.
<br>It’s scratchin on the walls
<br>In the closet, in the halls.
<br>It comes awake and I can’t control it.
<br>Hidin under the bed
<br>In my body, in my head.
<br>Why won’t somebody come and save me from this?
<br>Make it end.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chorus</i>
<br>I feel it deep within.
<br>It’s just beneath the skin.
<br>I must confess that I feel like a monster.
<br>I hate what I’ve become.
<br>The nightmare’s just begun.
<br>I must confess that I feel like a monster.
<br>I, I feel like a monster. (x2)
</p>

<p><i>Verse 2</i>
<br>My secret side I keep
<br>Hid under lock and key.
<br>I keep it caged but I can’t control it.
<br>Cause if I let him out
<br>He’ll tear me up, break me down.
<br>Why won’t somebody come and save me from this?
<br>Make it end.
</p>

<p>
<i>Chorus</i>
<br>I feel it deep within.
<br>It’s just beneath the skin.
<br>I must confess that I feel like a monster.
<br>I hate what I’ve become.
<br>The nightmare’s just begun.
<br>I must confess that I feel like a monster.
<br>I, I feel like a monster. (x2)
</p>

<p><i>Bridge</i>
<br>It’s hidin in the dark.
<br>Its teeth are razor sharp.
<br>There’s no escape for me.
<br>It wants my soul, it wants my heart
<br>No one can hear me scream.
<br>Maybe it’s just a dream
<br>Or maybe it’s inside of me.
<br>Stop this monster!
</p>


<p>
<i>Final chorus</i>
<br>I feel it deep within.
<br>It’s just beneath the skin.
<br>I must confess that I <b>FEEL LIKE A MONSTER</b>.
<br>I hate what I’ve become.
<br>The nightmare’s just begun.
<br>I must confess that I feel like a monster.
<br>I feel it deep within.
<br>It’s just beneath the skin.
<br>I must confess that I feel like a monster.
<br>I gotta lose control.
<br>It’s something ready go.
<br>I must confess that I feel like a monster.
</p>
